## Hi my name is Lucky
<p> I am a bio major with a minor in evolutionary bio. I am a junior and I am originally from Kansa, Overland Park. I have a CNA license and I have so many fun stories about medical horrors. I am really passionate about my cutie-pie dog. He is 11 but he will always be my baby. </p>
